# Landing Page

## this is the Landing Page

version 1.2.0


**the structure of the page** is simply just the header which contains the nav bar, 4 sections and a footer!

1. if you select any button on the nav bar it should lead you (scroll) to the specific section of the page.

2. It should be clear which section is being viewed while scrolling through the page as it's has some styling to it *using `<your_active_class>`*

3. the navbar button coressponding the active section has some styling *using `<active__class>`*

4. what is special about this page is that it's built dynamically using javaScript and not only html and css!
which means that the navigation bar changes as you add/remove sections, *(Navigation is built dynamically as an unordered list)*, this page has 4 sections and 4 buttons but you can change this number easily in the html.

5. the page is usable in the mobil viewport as i have set `<text-warp>` to `<wrap>` in the CSS file.

### installation:
download the ZIP file, extract it, and render the HTML file in your favorite browser and it should be working.
